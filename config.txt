dimensions=2 
# embedding dimensions to visualize

extended_xyz_file=ASAP-pca-d6.xyz 
# path to extended xyz file containing embedding coordinates and properties (molecular or atomic)

property_visualize=TotEnergy 
# this property will be used for coloring. For atomic embedding give column number in xyze file

mode=compound 
# can be "compound" for e.g. molecule or lattice embedding or "atomic" for atomic embedding

consider_species=all 
#can also be sth like C,H

title=TEST 
# title for the plot
